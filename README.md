# Lecture 08-3 FUNCTIONS IN MIPS

This is a folder containing the lecture materials for Friday, April 3rd's on-line lecture. 
It includes  
• PDF of my lecture slides `slides.pdf`   
• the material covered by lecture as notes `NOTES.md`   
• some sample MIPS assembly source code in `samples`  
I'll email you an invitation to the Zoom lecture which will be held at 3-4pm.

Today we'll look at writing and calling functions within MIPS assembly. This
has us look more carefully at the `JAL` and `JR` instructions, at the conventional
roles of each of the MIPS registers, how to maintain a call stack and each function's
frame, and more generally the function *calling conventions* that all MIPS32 
programmers have agreed to follow.

Related to this particular topic, I've also included PDF of some notes
on MIPS programming from Daniel Ellard. These are quite good and were
used in the 90s version of Harvard's CS-50/CS-51 courses. You can find it and
other materials
[on his personal site](http://ellard.org/dan/www/Courses/). 
These MIPS notes are at the bottom. Page 43 in the notes (48 in the PDF)
covers the material of my lecture.
